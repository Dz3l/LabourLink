 LabourLink
Overview
LabourLink is a web platform designed to empower construction workers in third-world countries by simplifying the job application process and reducing reliance on informal networks and luck. Workers can create personalized profiles using their national IDs, showcase their skills, and apply for jobs directly from any device. Contractors can post projects, specifying manpower needs, location, and pay rates, and find suitable workers efficiently. An AI-powered matching system enhances job-worker compatibility by analyzing skills, location, and pay expectations.
The platform aims to bridge the gap between construction workers and contractors, fostering economic opportunities and streamlining hiring processes in developing nations.
Features

National ID Authentication: Workers log in using their national IDs for quick and secure registration.
Worker Profiles: Workers can display their skills, experience, and location, creating a professional portfolio.
Project Posting: Contractors can list projects with details like required skills, manpower, pay rate, and location.
Job Search: Workers can search for jobs by skills, location, or pay rate, with filters for precise results.
AI-Powered Matching: An intelligent system recommends the best worker-project matches based on skills, proximity, and pay expectations.
Responsive Design: Optimized for low-end smartphones and unreliable internet, ensuring accessibility in resource-constrained environments.
Multilingual Support: Planned support for local languages (e.g., Swahili, Hausa) to cater to diverse users.
Offline Capabilities: Progressive Web App (PWA) features for offline access (planned for future releases).

Tech Stack

Front-End: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (with plans to migrate to React for dynamic components).
Back-End (Planned): Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI, PostgreSQL for data storage.
AI Integration: Basic matching using scikit-learn’s cosine similarity; advanced integration with xAI’s API (see xAI API).
Authentication: JWT-based authentication for secure national ID login.
Deployment: Planned for AWS/Heroku with Cloudflare CDN for low-bandwidth regions.

Installation
Prerequisites

Node.js (v16 or higher) for running the back-end (future implementation).
PostgreSQL (v13 or higher) for database (future implementation).
Python (v3.8 or higher) for AI components (optional).
Git for cloning the repository.

Steps

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/labourlink.git
cd labourlink


Serve the Front-End:The current prototype is a single HTML file (labourlink.html). Serve it using a local server:
npx http-server

Open http://localhost:8080/labourlink.html in your browser.

Set Up Back-End (Future):

Install dependencies:npm install express pg bcrypt jsonwebtoken


Configure PostgreSQL with the schema provided in schema.sql (to be added).
Update environment variables in .env:DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/labourlink
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key


Run the server:node server.js




Set Up AI Matching (Optional):

Install Python dependencies:pip install fastapi uvicorn scikit-learn


Run the FastAPI server:uvicorn main:app --reload

Roadmap

Short-Term (1–3 months):
Migrate front-end to React for modular components.
Implement back-end with Node.js/Express and PostgreSQL.
Develop basic AI matching using cosine similarity.
Add form validation and dynamic job updates.


Medium-Term (3–6 months):
Integrate xAI’s API for advanced matching (see xAI API).
Add multilingual support and PWA features.
Conduct beta testing in a pilot region (e.g., Lagos, Nigeria).


Long-Term (6–12 months):
Introduce SMS-based authentication for low-internet areas.
Expand to multiple regions (e.g., Kampala, Nairobi).
Implement feedback loops for AI model improvement.
